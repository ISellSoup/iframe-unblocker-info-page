            <h1>What happened?</h1>
            <p>I have decided to stop hosting here to encourage other people to host the unblocker themselves.</p>

            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p>I do not feel comfortable hosting an unblocker that so many people use.  
            Also, if one person gets their domain blocked, other people won't lose access.</p>

            <h1>How do I host?</h1>
            <p>First, find a device other than your Chromebook.  Most devices should work, but a laptop/desktop is ideal.  
            Next go to GitHub and search for iframe unblocker.  Open the repository made by "ISellSoup" and download the code as a ZIP (Code > Download ZIP).  
            The iframe unblocker is not a proxy, it is a static site.  Everything runs on your device.  
            This means that you don't have to use dynamic web hosting, which ALWAYS costs money.  
            To host the code, search for static web hosting and choose any service you want.  Ideally, you should pick a free option.  
            On your hosting service create a new site and upload your ZIP file when prompted.</p>
            
            <h1>That sounds like a lot. Do I have to host to use it?</h1>
            <p>No, web hosting is not neccesary to run the unblocker.  It will run on most online html viewers if you just copy-paste the code.  
            You also could just rely on someone else for hosting, but I strongly recommend hosting it yourself.</p>

            <h1>Why wait for u7?</h1>
            <p>u7 (major update 7) will come with cleaner scource code and settings at the top of the html doc.</p>
