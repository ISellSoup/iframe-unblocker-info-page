            <h2>What happened?</h2>
            <p>I have decided to stop hosting the unblocker to encourage other people to host it for themselves.</p>

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>I do not feel comfortable hosting an unblocker that so many people use.  
            Also, if one person gets their domain blocked, other people won't lose access.</p>

            <h2>How do I host?</h2>
            <p>First, find a device other than your Chromebook.  Most devices should work, but a laptop/desktop is ideal.  
            Next go to GitHub and search for iframe unblocker.  Open the repository made by "ISellSoup" and download the code as a ZIP (Code > Download ZIP).  
            The iframe unblocker is not a proxy, it is a static site.  Everything runs on your device.  
            This means that you don't have to use full stack web hosting, which usually costs more money.  
            To host the code, search for static web hosting and choose any service you want.  Ideally, you should pick a free option.  
            On your hosting service create a new static site and upload your ZIP file when prompted.</p>
            
            <h2>That sounds like a lot. Do I have to host to use it?</h2>
            <p>No, web hosting is not neccesary to run the unblocker.  It will run on most online html viewers if you just copy-paste the code.  
            You also could just rely on someone else for hosting, but I strongly recommend hosting it yourself.</p>

            <h2>What was u7?</h2>
            <p>u7 (major update 7) came with cleaner scource code and settings at the top of the html doc.</p>
